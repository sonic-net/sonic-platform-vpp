# Areas of Work
This sections lists pending areas of work for SONiC-VPP. At a high level the following are the areas of work. Section below describes how we phase the execution.

1. Support all SAI APIs and make changes to VPP (if necessary)
2. New features to be added to SONiC or VPP (e.g., IKE, Stateful firewall, DPI, etc)   
3. VPP configurability via configDB  
3. Debuggability of SONiC VPP  (logging, telemetry, counters)
4. Hardening
   - Restart of VPP,
   - Support warm restart in VPP (state reconciliation)
5. Performance Optimizations
   - Route convergence
   - Forwarding performance
6. Support various environments
   -AWS (container/VM)
   -K8S
   -KVM  (VM)
