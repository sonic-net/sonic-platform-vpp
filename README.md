# Description
SONiC-VPP is a platform under SONIC that supports VPP data plane. For more details about VPP see [What is VPP](https://s3-docs.fd.io/vpp/23.06/) 

This repo contains  scripts, Makefiles, configuration file, Docker files etc to build a SONIC-VPP image. It also pulls some extra git repos and makes these repos part of SONiC build. In this process it will prompt for user/password while cloning. There are some VPP platform specific Makefile, config files which are applied to the sonic-buildimage repo to facilitate the successful build of the SONiC-VPP image.

> Note: The first build takes good amount of time. The SONiC image build has two parts to it, [backend and frontend](https://github.com/sonic-net/sonic-buildimage/blob/master/README.buildsystem.md). The backend consumes a lot of time when the build is done first time. The follow on builds only do the frontend.

**Caveat**- *The documentation for this project is a work in progress and a bit terse. We hope to address this in coming weeks.* 

# Prerequisites
 * Linux host machine running ubuntu 18.x or later distribution (Ubuntu 20.x is preferred).
 * Install the following packages 

```
sudo apt-get install -y make automake autoconf
sudo apt install -y python3-pip
sudo pip3 install j2cli
```

 * Install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) and configure your system to allow running the 'docker' command without 'sudo':
    * Add current user to the docker group: `sudo gpasswd -a ${USER} docker`
    * Log out and log back in so that your group membership is re-evaluated

# SONiC VPP image build
There are two types of sonic-vpp image build targets supported
 * Single docker container image (*docker-sonic-vpp.gz*) with a subset of SONIC features
 * Comprehensive SONiC-VPP qemu VM image

## Building a single container image

Issue the command shown below. It will pull the required repos, setup the vpp platform, configure and then initiate the image build.

```
make sonic
```

Note- If your internet access is only through a proxy, set the http_proxy and issue the command as suggested below
```
http_proxy=http_proxy_url https_proxy=https_proxy_url no_proxy=localhost,127.0.0.1,<other_hosts_or_ipaddresses> make sonic
```

To use a different label for SONiC build
```
SONIC_CHECKOUT_LABEL=sonic_git_commit_label make sonic
```
To build a debug container image run below command
```
INSTALL_DEBUG_TOOLS=y make sonic
```

> Note: Refer the instructions above on how to pass proxy if internet access is only though proxy

The ./build directory contains all the repos pulled. The ./build/sonic-buildimage/target directory contains the
sonic vpp targets.

In case of a build failure just run below command. There is no need to do rest of targets in the Makefile.
```
make sonic_build
```

If internet access is only through a proxy use below command
```
http_proxy=http_proxy_url http_proxy=https_proxy_url no_proxy=localhost,127.0.0.1,other_hosts_or_ipaddresses make sonic
```

To use a different label for SONiC build
```
SONIC_CHECKOUT_LABEL=sonic_git_commit_label make sonic_build
```

> Note : The nightly build labels can be found [*here*](https://sonic-build.azurewebsites.net/ui/sonic/pipelines/142/builds?branchName=master)

The built image can be found at `./build/sonic-buildimage/target/docker-sonic-vpp.gz`.

### Testing the single container image

Refer to the [Getting started](docs/README.getting-started.md) document in docs directory for details. 


## Building a KVM VM image 
Run below make command (in case of proxy use the proxy parameters as mentioned above in the "make sonic" build)
```
make sonic_vm
```

To build a debug VM image image run below command
```
INSTALL_DEBUG_TOOLS=y make sonic_vm
```

The built vm image can be found at `build/sonic-buildimage/target/sonic-vpp.img.gz`.

### Testing the qemu VM image

Refer to the [document](docs/README.sonic_vm.md) in docs directory for details. 


# Troubleshooting

http(s)_proxy driven make fails sometimes with package download failure. It says hash mismatch. This may be caused
by some bug in the proxy which corrupts some bytes or downloaded package is incomplete. The fix is to run the
make sonic_build again.
