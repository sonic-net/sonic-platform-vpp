## Scope
This document describes the high level design of integrating vlan bridging functionality between SONIC and VPP. It provides
 - 802.1ad - TODO (not supported yet)
 - 802.1Q bridging
 - 802.1Q BVI interface for vlan routing

## Introduction
SONiC supports 802.1ad and 802.1q bridging support. This document's first version describes the 802.1q bridging 
 - Access port
   config vlan member add -u <portname> creates an un tagged bridge port. This will be translated to vpp in two steps
   1. creates a bridge with given vlan id as bridge id if the bridge with given id doesnot exist.
   2. set the port as member of bridge with appropriate tag rewrite
 - Trunk port
   config vlan member add  <portname> creates a tagged port bridge port. This will be translated to vpp in three steps
   1. creates a bridge with given vlan id as bridge id if the bridge with given aid does not exist.
   2. vpp trunk port operation is achieved through vlan subinterface. A subinterface is created for this vlan id. Note
      that this subinterface is only specific to vpp and does not appear in SONiC control plane data bases.
   3. set the vlan subinterface as bridge port
 - BVI port and 802.1Q routing
   config interface ip add/remove <vlan interface name> creates/removes BVI port on VPP 802.1Q bridge as below
   1. create a bvi interface with bvi<vlan bridge domain id> suffix 
   2. set the bvi port as member port of bridge domain to which Vlan interface belongs to.
   3. set the tag-rewrite as access port
   4. configure the IP address on to BVI interface
   5. Add subnet route for the IP of the BVI interface
   6. Enable the vlan bridge domain arp termination

## 802.1Q VLAN routing
  SONiC enables VLAN routing by configuring an IP address on the VLAN interface. If the VLAN interface has members to it then there will be bridge domain created
with vlan members as bridge domain ports. When an IP is configured on this VLAN interface then it should route the traffic from it's members using the VLAN IP address.
It also should take care of vlan tags rewrite for the traffic coming from VLAN members or sending on VLAN members. This is achieved by creating a BVI interface on
corresponding vlan bridge domain and programming the IP of VLAN on to BVI interface. BVI interface tag-rewrite is enabled to push 802.1q tags. This pops the tags of 
the traffice when leaving the BVI interface and pushes the tag for the traffic coming on to BVI interface.

## FDB\_ENTRY with ADD/DEL and FDB\_FLUSH
SONiC supports MAC database called FDB_TABLE for statically configured MAC entries and also it can learn MAC from the packets are forwarded to SONiC control plane. VPP switch learns the MAC addresses and maintains them in FIB table. SONiC supports ADD, DEL, FLUSH of MAC entries configuration and this is used to add, delete or flush the entries to/from VPP FIB. The MAC address learnt dynamically by VPP can be flushed per port/interface or per VLAN ID (bridge ID) or by default flush on all PORT IDs (interfaces) and VLAN IDs (bridges). Currently flushing of only dynamic entries that are learnt on VPP is supported. Statically added MAC entries and Entries added via Config file needs to be removed explicitly.

## Troubleshooting
There are some SONiC tools to debug SONiC side of functionality such as show commands, redis-dump, log files /var/log/syslog, /var/log/swss/ etc. You can connect gdb to the running processes and get useful debug information provided the image is built with INSTALL_DEBUG_TOOLS=y option.
 
For vpp data path troubleshooting a user can invoke vppctl to connec to VPP and run a CLI. Other option is to run “show platform vpp” command to see the working of vpp. “show platform” command of SONiC is extended to support vpp platform side of commands.
